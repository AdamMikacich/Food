# Food
A food signups manager for Team 254 built from scratch.

### About
This project is a redesigned food portal for Team 254 created from the ground up. The application currently consists of three main views: a calendar, an event modal, and a settings modal. This redesign solves multiple issues found within the original food.team254.com site by providing functional mobile support, increased readability, and user-friendly design.

### Install
- Clone the repository
- Install node modules using `npm install`

### Scripts
- `npm run dev` starts the bundler with a web server
- `npm run watch` starts the bundler without a web server
- `npm run build` builds the bundle once

### Note
Import Vue using `import Vue from 'vue/dist/vue.js';` so the bundler works properly
